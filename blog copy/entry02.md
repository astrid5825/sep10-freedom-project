# The Research
I needed to know more about the already existing tech for the topic I choose, so first I looked up different websites for my topic. To see what was already avaliable. Low and Behold, there were a few websites for recipes. Similar in nature but different by desgin, all looking cool and unquie despite talking about the same things. This gave me a few ideas on what I should do for my topic and my project. They also shared some helpful recipes for my Project.

I used google to my advantage here, Not only did it have websites but, I could compare the websites on different tabs to see which looked better **(In my opinion)**. It helped me get a better idea about what I wanted to do with my project.
