# My Topic
Orignally, I wanted to do a blog about Norwegian pastries. But I decided to expand to different types of baking recepies, I believe I could use tech and coding for baking in different ways, and thats what i'm going to prove. I have multiple ideas of things I could do to show this as well. Like making a cool interactive website that has recipes! 

# Planning & Process
The problem I am facing is not only motivation or ideas. I want to try and make something original for once but, I can't really think of anything new *to* make. The two ideas that I have where either a holographic cookbook that could be attached to you like a watch, or a tutorial website that actually helps you through the receipe. I think both are really cool and helpful but I don't know which one I want to stick with for the future. Whatever I pick, I need to try and stay motivated throughout this project.
