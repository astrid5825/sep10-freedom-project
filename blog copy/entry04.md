## Tinkering
Seeing the CSS animations made me think more creativly, These might be useful to make more eye-catching websites (the website itself s below). I've tried to put these in a Repo to no luck, but this is more likely due to me just missing a step. I plan to have animations in a website to pop out/catch the eye/draw the attention too more important informaton.

[(website in question, This has examples on the different animations)](https://animate.style/)
