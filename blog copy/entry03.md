## My idea process
I was thinking of making the process of baking more helpful for beginners, and helpful to people that don't like loud noises. So thats how I thought of my products, surpisingly nobody else thought of them. The concept is somewhat simple but in practice I know it would help people who want to start baking. I wanted to add a thrid thing but I feel like the thing I want to add is kind of out of place for the website i'd make, which would focus more on helping you take the sweets out the oven then baking making the batter. Bluetooth would play a huge part in this, not wanting wires near the food, it would be the easiest option.
