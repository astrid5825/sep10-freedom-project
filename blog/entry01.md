# My Topic
Orignally, I wanted to do a blog about Norwegian pastries. But I decided to expand to different types of baking recepies, I believe I could use tech and coding for baking in different ways, and thats what i'm going to prove. I have multiple ideas of things I could do to show this as well. Like making a cool interactive website that has recipes!
