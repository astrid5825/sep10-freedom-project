##### 5/31/24 woah schools almost done

# Expo and Feedback
The Expo was fun, personally I was scared that the website wasn't enough but people still enjoyed my website, which is all I care about. I didn't get much feedback, but a lot of questions, which is Ok. I enjoyed answering them and showing off my ideas to people, and seeing them interact with my website is the best thing by far in my opinion.

My main takeaway is to stick with your plan. I feel like I could've done more if I stuck with it, as well as use the tools available to me. I made my website from scratch so it looked wayy less good then the others during the Expo. Going into 11th, I need to stick by my plans and use everything available to me to make the best product I could've made. But for what its worth, my project looked ok

#In-Class presentation
I really liked to present, so I gave it my all in my in-class presentation. My grades somewhat reflect that but there are still areas I should improve in. I didn't even realize I forgot to say "Thank you" After I presented, I'm keeping that in mind for my next presentations in all of my classes. Honestly, this was more fun then the expo was for me.
